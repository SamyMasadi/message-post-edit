## About
The project started as an implementation of the LCS algorithm in JavaScript. 
The rest of the project involved building out a responsive HTML & CSS user interface to support message posting and editing.


The user can post messages on the timeline, and then can edit the messages.
After an edit, the page will use the LCS algorithm to show the differences between the original message and the edited message.
